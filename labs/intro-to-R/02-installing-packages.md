# Installing packages in *RStudio*
One of the major advantages of *R* is its extensibility via *literally thousands* of additional packages tailored to specific applications. There is an extensive ecosystem of packages specifically for spatial applications. There is also a large array of packages collectively known as 'the tidyverse' that we will be using, which make data management and manipulation a little bit easier than in base *R*.

All this means it is essential to know how to install packages. Fortunately it is straightforward, as will be demonstrated by installing some packages right now.

## Installing `tidyverse`
Navigate to the **Tools - Install Packages...** menu option.

In the dialogue that appears start typing in the **Packages** box `tidyverse`. When the full name appears, select it. Make sure the **Install dependencies** checkbox is selected, then click **OK**.

All hell will break loose. Sit back and enjoy the feeling that you are doing real computing.

### What's going on?
This particular installation includes a *whole bunch* of packages and will take some time.

If there are problems, ask for help. If everyone is having problems I got something wrong, and we will figure it out.

## Installing `sf`, `tmap` and `tmaptools`
Now you know how to install packages, do it again, for the ones named in the heading. Note that you can install all of them at once, simply by specifying all of them in the **Packages** list in the dialogue.

## On to the next thing.
Now all that's done we are ready to move on to [the actual content of this session](03-simple-data-exploration.md).
