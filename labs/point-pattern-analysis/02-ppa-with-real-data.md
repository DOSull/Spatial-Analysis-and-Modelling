# Point pattern analysis with real data

```{r}
# Reload some libraries in case you are restarting partway through
library(spatstat)
library(RColorBrewer)
# also store the initial graphic options in a variable
# so we can reset them at any time
pardefaults <- par()
```

Now we need to read two data files, one with the point events and one with the study area. These are [here](ak-tb-cases.geojson?raw=true) and [here](ak-tb.geojson?raw=true). Load the `sf` library for handling spatial data.

```{r}
library(sf)
```

and use it to load the data:

```{r}
ak <- st_read("ak-tb.geojson")
tb <- st_read("ak-tb-cases.geojson")
```

Check that things line up OK by mapping them using `tmap`.

```{r}
library(tmap)

tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(tb) +
  tm_dots()
```

## Reprojecting the data

For PPA we really need to be working in a projected coordinate system that uses real spatial units (like metres, even better kilometres), not latitude-longitude.

```{r}
st_crs(ak)
st_crs(tb)
```

By now you should recognise these as 'unprojected' lat-lon, which is no good to us. We should instead use the New Zealand Transverse Mercator. We get the proj4 string for this from an appropriate source, such as [epsg.io/2193](https://epsg.io/2193), and use it to transform the two layers. I have modified the projection to make the units km (the `units` setting) rather than metres as this seems to have a dramatic effect on how well `spatstat` runs. It also makes it easier to interpret results meaningfully.

```{r}
nztm <- '+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=173 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1600 +y_0=10000 +datum=WGS84 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=km'

ak <- st_transform(ak, nztm)
tb <- st_transform(tb, nztm)
```

Now we should check that things still line up OK.

```{r}
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(tb) +
  tm_dots()
```

## Converting spatial data to `spatstat` data

OK. So much for the spatial data. `spatstat` works in its own little world and performs PPA on `ppp` objects, which have two components, a set of (*x*, *y*) points, and a study area or 'window'.

This is quite a fiddly business, which never seems to get any easier (every time I do it, I have to look it up in help). We need some conversion functions `as_Spatial` from the `sf` package, to convert from `sf` objects to `sp` objects and then some more in the `maptools` package to get from those to `spatstat` `ppp` objects. We will also use a (short) `dplyr` pipeline to do the conversion. So first load `maptools` and `dplyr`:

```{r}
library(maptools)
library(dplyr)
```

If `maptools` doesn't load, then make sure it is installed and try again. Now we use `as.ppp` to make a point pattern from the geometry of the `tb` data set.

```{r}
tb.pp <- tb$geometry %>% # the geometry is all we need
  as("Spatial") %>%      # this converts to sp geometry
  as.ppp()               # this is a maptools function to convert to spatstat ppp
```

and plot it to take a look:

```{r}
plot(tb.pp)
```

That's better than nothing, but ideally we want to use the land area for the study area. Again, we use a conversion function from `maptools`.

```{r}
tb.pp$window <- ak %>%
  st_union() %>%       # combine all the polygons into a single shape
  as("Spatial") %>%    # convert to sp
  as.owin()            # convert to spatstat owin
```

Now let's take a look:

```{r}
plot(density(tb.pp))
plot(tb.pp, add = T)
```

Finally!

If we were doing a lot of this kind of analysis starting with lat-lon datasets, then we would build a function from some of the elements above to automate all these steps. In this case, since we are only running the analysis once for this lab, I will leave that as an exercise for the reader...
